<h3>Drop off</h3>
<p>
The best way to reach us is to drop off your donations at our destinated locations. Currently we have one drop box located on the first floor lobby of the Sigma building. If you don't need to track your donation, just pack your items and drop off. If you want to track your donations, here are the steps:
<ol>
  <li>Register your items using the "Donate now" link on the right and get a tracking number.</li>
  <li>Fill in a tracking form at the donation box, including your contact information and tracking number.</li>
  <li>Attach the tracking form to the donation before dropping off.</li>
</ol>
Afterwards, you can track the status of your donations using the "Track donation" link on the right.
</p>
<h3>Pick up</h3>
<p>If it's incovenient for you to drop off your items, we can also pick them up. You need to register your items as we mentioned earlier and check "I need pick-up" in the form. After that we will contact you and arrange a pick-up. 
</p>
<p>
It's especially helpful if you could clearly describe what you need us to pick up and provide us with pictures, so that we can plan the transportation and avoid taking things we can't deal with. Due to the cost of this service, we have to accumulate enough requests and process them together. There can be a long waiting time. We thank you for your patience.
