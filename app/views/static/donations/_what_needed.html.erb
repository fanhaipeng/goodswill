<h3>What we accept</h3>
<p>
Goodswill accepts high quality goods that you no longer require.  Please ensure all your donated goods are clean and of good condition.  Our aim is to distribute quality items that not only meet the needs of the people we are helping, but also show the recipient that they are cared about and valued.  The key word to remember when sorting your items for donation is "dignity".  If it is something you feel embarrassed to own or give to your friends, it is not something suitable.

<p>
Sometimes our recipients send us a list of things that they need. If you are short of ideas of what you can donate, feel free to check out the list below for inspiration.

<ul>
<li><a href="#">Migrant Children's Foundation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hopefosterhome.com/needs.htm" target="_blank">New Hope Foundation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
You might find the list to be very specific and think it's hard for you to find the exact match. Don't worry. They also accept things that are similar and things not on the list. We will also do our best to find other organizations that can utilize whatever you donate.
